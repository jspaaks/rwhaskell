# Copier template for Real-World Haskell projects

Copier template for generating a generic Haskell project.

To use, first install [`copier` from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/copier/).

```shell
pipx install copier
```

Then run `copier` with the template directory as argument:

```shell
copier copy ~/somewhere/rwhaskell/template
```

`copier` will then ask you a few questions and generate a directory with some files.
